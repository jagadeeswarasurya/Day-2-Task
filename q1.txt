The Document Object:
-------------------

The Document object represents the web page loaded in the browser window. 
It serves as a hierarchical structure, encapsulating all elements and content within the HTML document. 
The Document object provides methods and properties for accessing and manipulating the structure, content, and styles of the web page. 
Developers commonly interact with the Document object to dynamically update content, handle events, and modify the layout of the page.

Key Features of the Document Object:
------------------------------------

Accessing Elements: 

The Document object provides methods such as getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and querySelector() to access and select HTML elements within the document.

Manipulating Content:

Developers can dynamically create, modify, or remove elements and their attributes using methods like createElement(), appendChild(), and removeChild().

Styling Elements: 
The Document object enables the manipulation of CSS styles through properties like style, classList, and className, allowing for dynamic styling of elements.

The Window Object
-----------------

the Window object represents the browser window or tab itself. 
It serves as the global object in the browser environment and acts as a container for various properties, methods, and events related to the browser window. 
The Window object facilitates interactions with the browser, including navigation, window management, and handling of events triggered by user actions.

Key Features of the Window Object:
----------------------------------

Global Scope: 

Variables and functions declared without explicit scoping are attached to the Window object, making it the global context for JavaScript execution within the browser.


Browser Information: 

The Window object provides information about the browser environment, including dimensions, location, history, and navigation state.


Window Management: 

Developers can control the behavior of browser windows and tabs using methods like open(), close(), and resizeTo().


Event Handling: 

The Window object enables the handling of various events triggered by user interactions, such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.


Distinguishing Between Document and Window Objects:
--------------------------------------------------

Scope: 

The Document object primarily deals with the content and structure of the HTML document loaded in the browser, 
while the Window object represents the browser window or tab as a container for the document.

Content vs. Container: 

The Document object focuses on manipulating the content and structure of the HTML document, 
while the Window object facilitates interactions with the browser environment.


Manipulation vs. Control: 
Developers use the Document object to manipulate the content, structure, and style of the web page, 
whereas the Window object enables control over browser behavior, window management, and event handling.
